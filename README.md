# Speech-to-Text and Text Translation App

This is a React.js and Tailwind CSS powered web application that enables users to transcribe speech to text and then translate the text into the language of their choice. It utilizes the APIs of both OpenAI and Whisper (Xenova) for speech recognition and translation, respectively.

## Features

- Real-time Speech-to-Text: Users can speak into the app, and the speech recognition engine will convert the spoken words into text in real-time.

- Language Translation: After transcribing the speech into text, users can choose a target language from a wide range of options. The app will then translate the text into the selected language using the powerful Whisper translation API.

- User-Friendly Interface: The application offers an intuitive and user-friendly interface, making it easy for users of all levels to interact with the app.

## Prerequisites

Before running the application, make sure you have the following dependencies installed on your system:

- Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager)
- OpenAI API key: Obtain an API key from OpenAI to enable speech recognition.
- Whisper API key: Get an API key from Xenova (Whisper) to enable text translation.
